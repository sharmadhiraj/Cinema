# Cinema

A Sample Android Project with Architecture Components & Modern Practices.

**Cinema** uses [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/).

## Work In Progress

### To be implemented

1. **Data Binding**: Utilizing data binding for connecting UI components with data sources in a
   declarative way.
2. **Lifecycles**: Managing lifecycle-aware components to handle Android lifecycle events
   efficiently.
3. **LiveData**: Implementing LiveData for observing data changes in a lifecycle-aware manner.
4. **Navigation**: Utilizing Navigation component for managing navigation within the app.
5. **Paging**: Implementing paging to load large sets of data gradually.
6. **Room**: Integrating Room for local database storage.
7. **ViewModel**: Utilizing ViewModel to manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-aware manner.
8. **Extension Functions**: Writing extension functions for adding functionalities to existing
   classes without subclassing.
9. **Hilt (Dependency Injection)**: Implementing Hilt for dependency injection.
10. **Coroutines**: Utilizing Kotlin Coroutines for asynchronous programming.
11. **MVVM (Model View ViewModel)**: Implementing MVVM architecture to separate concerns and improve
    testability.
12. **Custom Views**: Creating custom views to enhance UI/UX and demonstrate custom UI components.
13. **Retrofit (Network)**: Integrating Retrofit for network requests and API interactions.
14. **Jetpack Compose**: Exploring Jetpack Compose for modern UI development.
15. **Unit Testing**: Implementing unit tests to ensure individual components of your app function
    correctly.
16. **UI Testing**: Adding UI tests to verify the behavior and interactions of your app's user
    interface.

**Note:** This app's design is intentionally simple to emphasize architectural focus.
